# CareGuard AI

### Clinical Appointment No-Show Prediction & Agentic Care Coordination System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

CareGuard AI is an intelligent healthcare operations system designed to:

1. Predict the likelihood of patient appointment no-shows using machine learning.
2. Generate structured, actionable care coordination recommendations using an agentic AI workflow.

The system supports healthcare administrators in identifying high-risk appointments and proactively intervening to improve patient attendance and operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Missed medical appointments (no-shows) cause:

* Revenue loss for healthcare institutions
* Inefficient resource allocation
* Delayed patient care
* Increased operational burden

This project builds an AI-driven system that predicts no-show risk and provides structured intervention strategies to mitigate appointment drop-offs.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

* The system assists operational decision-making and does not replace clinical judgment.
* Model outputs are probabilistic and may contain uncertainty.
* Bias in historical healthcare data may affect predictions.
* Human oversight is recommended before acting on AI-generated recommendations.
